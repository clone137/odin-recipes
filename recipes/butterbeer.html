    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      "Why don't we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks, it's a
      bit cold, isn't it?" - Hermione Granger (Goblet of Fire)
    </p>
    <p>
      Inspired by a recipe for authentic "buttered beer" (AKA butterbeer) from
      the 1500s, this stuff will make you feel all warm and tingly inside. Make
      sure to choose an ale that's not too sweet, as sugar is added in the
      recipe. You may also need to try a few different ales before you find
      something that works for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If drinking chilled, you may want to combine cold milk or cream with the
      butterbeer in a 1:1 ratio. This will taste more like an eggnog, and is
      just as satisfying when it's cold outside.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>44g sugar</li>
      <li>2 egg yolks</li>
      <li>500ml ginger beer (or dark mild ale)</li>
      <li>0.88g ginger</li>
      <li>1.18g nutmeg</li>
      <li>0.66g cinnamon</li>
      <li>28.4g butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, whisk the sugar and yolks until pale</li>
      <li>
        Add beer to saucepan over low heat, and whisk in ginger and nutmeg
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the beer mixture has warmed, stir in sugar and yolks. It will
        combine to form a creamy color. (Let steam slowly, but do not boil, or
        the yolks will harden.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat when the mixture has thickened. Stir in butter until it
        has melted completely
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy hot in a large mug, or ice cold with milk</li>
    </ol>
