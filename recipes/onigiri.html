    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Onigiri are Japanese rice balls. They come in a variety of fillings,
      including chicken, tuna, and salmon. More traditional fillings include
      bonito flakes and soy sauce, roe, and chopped Japanese pickles
      (tsukemono). You can also experiment with different shapes - round,
      square, trianglular, and so on.
